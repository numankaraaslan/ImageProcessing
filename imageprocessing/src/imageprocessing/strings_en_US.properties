how_to = This program can be used for educational or research purposes.\n\nRealtime Image Processing is a real time image processor program which can fetch webcam feed or a video file and apply up to 10 effects sequentially. Oprations will be applied from the small number to bigger numbers one on the next. The Save Image button will save the current image to saved<<Date-Time>.bmp file automatically to your desktop. Save operations button will save the current operations to operations<Date-Time>.config file automatically to your desktop. With Load Operations button you can load the operations file you have saved. Reset Operations button will reset all the operations to original normal values. The effects that can be applied in this program are:\n\nGrayscale converts current image to grayscale, 1 channeled image.\n\nBinary Image converts current image to binary (0, 1), 1 channeled format.\n\nNegative Colors inverses (255 - value) all the R, G and B values of pixels of the current image.\n\nBirghtness can increase or decrease the brightness of the current image.\n\nContrast can increase or decrease the contrast of the current image.\n\nCrop Colors will set all pixels' R, G and B values of the current image to lower boundary and upper boundary. No effect will happen if values are empty. For example if you set lower to 100, all pixels will have at least 100 as R, G and B. Works like contrast decreasing.\n\nFix RGB effect can set fixed values to R, G or B channels of every pixel on the current image seperately. Negative values are not allowed here. Empty values will be left as it is. For example if you set R to 100, every pixel will be set to (100, G, B) and G or B values will not be effected.\n\nChange RGB effect can increase or decrease R, G or B channels of every pixel on the current image seperately. Negative values are allowed here to decrease values. Empty values will be left as it is. For example if you set R to 100, every pixel will be set to (R + 100, G, B) and G or B values will not be effected.\n\nDilation effect will be more useful on binary images. This effect will work like noise reduction.\n\nErosion is also useful on binary images. This effect will make black areas look more solid in white areas.\n\nDegradation will make bright colors brighter and darker colors darker. This effect will add or remove the given value from all R, G and B values. High values will cause a black and white image and cause loss of colors. This effect cannot be applied to grayscale images.\n\nBlur will simply blur the current image. This effect creates a window with given value X given value and applies it to each pixel.\n\nCLAHE is contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization. This effect removes the disadvantage of different lighting on current image and produces a grayscale high constrast image.\n\nGhost effect will store indicated number of last frames in the memory and add them up in a weighted fashion, where earlier frames have lower weights. By this way, it creates a gliding effect.\n\nConvolution effect will apply 3X3 kernel on current image. You can invent a blur or edge detection with this option.\n\nEdge Detection effect will detect horizontal and vertical edged on current image.\n
